                    HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning
                    and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web
                    page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).

                    "Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or
                    between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet
                    and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide
                    Web.

                    Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a
                    document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes
                    how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.

                    CSS is one of the core languages of the open Web and is standardized across Web browsers according
                    to the W3C specification. Developed in levels, CSS1 is now obsolete, CSS2.1 is a recommendation, and
                    CSS3, now split into smaller modules, is progressing on the standardization track.

                <p>
                    JavaScript is mostly used in the browser, enabling developers to manipulate webpage content through
                    the DOM, manipulate data with AJAX and IndexedDB, draw graphics with canvas, interact with the
                    device running the browser through various APIs, and more. JavaScript is one of the world's most
                    commonly-used languages, owing to the recent growth and performance improvement of APIs available in
                    browsers.
